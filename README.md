# Algorithm API practice project

This practice project serves as a way to simultaneously practice common interview algorithm problems and Java/Spring conventions. By leveraging Spring Boot, this API will provide simple endpoints for each algorithm that can take the necessary parameters and provide the result as a JSON response payload.
